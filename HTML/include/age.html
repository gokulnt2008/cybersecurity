        Example on the problem<br><br>
        Imagine you installed an EXE installer of a social media site and downloaded it without 
        reading the privacy policy and have entered your phone number. The nest day you get numerous 
        messages from unknown people and when you browsed the new social media app you found that the entire 
        users phone numbers where present there and they where the one who were texting you all night. 
        Now you went to read the privacy policy and found that your phone number will be known to everybody 
        using the app. This is a small problem that can be fixed but what if there were some big issues caused 
        because of not reading the privacy policy of a website? So no matter how big a privacy policy looks just 
        read it thoroughly.
