        Precautions<br><br>

        •   Hackers all around the world will be logged in to any website. They also might try to steal your personal information, but we must be aware and not give our personal information to the hackers. <br>
        •   While in social media’s, when someone asks for your details (no matter who) just log off and don’t reply anything. The logic is to be protected while surfing the net.<br>
        •   When there is a situation which makes you irritated (like a unknown person is pinging you many times) just tell your parents or report to a cyber coordination centre.<br><br>
    </p>
        <div style="border-top: 1px solid #eeeeee;"></div>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Why hackers need it?<br><br>
        •	Hackers in social media or games may talk to you, at this point the people who talk to you are not only hackers but many others who need your personal information for many reasons. As mentioned above hackers can trade your personal or contact information to anybody who can make a use of it.<br><br>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Problems Caused<br><br>
        •	Your phone numbers or contact information can be spammed or important account details can be read and a unknown transaction can also take place.<br>
        •	Your private data like photos can be read and posted on the internet.<br>
        •	Another huge problem is when the hacker posts unwanted contents by logging in your account.<br><br>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Example on the problem<br><br>
        Think you are playing your favourite online game and you have a chat option there. Someone in the game is asking your email account and you give it without any worries, now the next day you receive a email to download a very good electronic comic book. You downloaded it on your desktop and soon after you open it you see your computer automatically shut down and when you again switch on your computer you see your personal information deleted, now when this happens to a very big organisation it’s going to be a very huge problem. For protecting this we must follow all the precautions mentioned above.
