        Example on the problem<br><br>
        Think you gave your phone number to an unknown website, now the owner might be a hacker who
        trades the login details of users to other companies. Now that company wants to advertise and sell
        a product and you will receive tons of calls from different numbers to make you buy that product somehow.
        This is a very simple problem. But what about a very big issue created like transaction of your account 
        to unknown accounts? In order to protect ourselves from being hacked we must follow the precautions
        mentioned above
